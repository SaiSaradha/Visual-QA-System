To run the code (main.py) or the script (runme.sh), make sure the following files are downloaded and in the directory :
    1. We need the features from image data. A quick way to do that is to download the vgg features for the coco dataset already
    available from here -https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/ and add to directory "image_data"
    2. For the word vectors, I used the Stanford GloVe Model. Pretrained word vectors can be downloaded from 
    here - https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and add to directory "pretrained"
    3. Download MS COCO train, val and test images from here - http://cocodataset.org/#download and add to directory "raw_images"
    4. Download train/val Annotations and train/val/test questions from the same COCO webpage - http://cocodataset.org/#download and add
    to directory "text_data"
    5. Now run runme.sh
